    "text": "Getting there\nBeing an overland backpacker, flying was out of the question. There is no rail line connecting Kuala Lumpur to Malacca — at least not one that I am aware of — which means coach it is.\n\n1. Kuala Lumpur City to Terminal Bersepadu Selatan\nMy first task was to make my way to the Terminal Bersepadu Selatan (TBS) bus station. This is a ginormous bus station that has coaches leaving to all corners of the East Malaysian peninsula, including to Singapore (and possibly to Thailand).\nWith time on my hands and luxury the least of my concerns, I hopped on the light rail at Plaza Rakyat nearest my hotel and rode seven stops to Bandar Tasik Selatan for 3 MYR — the ticket was actually 2.90 MYR, but the ticket machines do not accept cards and do not dispense change; so, I was robbed of 0.10 MYR (~£0.02)!\nBandar Tasik Selatan is connected to the TBS by a bridge. There was no need to leave the station.\n\n\n2. TBS to Melaka Sentral\nAt the counter, I bought the 11:45 to Melaka Sentral, operated by Melor Interline, for 12 MYR. Delayed by 15 minutes, the coach was mostly empty and spacious and the journey itself was a straight forward two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Ticket to Malacca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Coach from TBS to Malacca mostly empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Terminal Bersepadu Selatan.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Melaka Sentral to Melaka City\nArriving at Melaka Sentral gives you the first indication that all is not well in Malacca: a moderately-sized bus station haunted by bleak and derelict shop units that hark back to past fortunes. The information desk looked like it was abandoned long ago, but after some walking around and asking it turned out that intercity coaches terminated at one end of the station, while local buses terminated at the opposite end.\nA taxi to the city centre was just shy of 10 MYR, but I wanted to travel like a local. At the local end of the station, the bus at bay 16 took me through the city centre at a cost 1.40 MYR and about 45 minutes (actually, it cost me 5 MYR, because the bus does not give change. Robbed again of 3.60 MYR, ~£0.72!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Local bus bay 16 took me to Mahkota Parade in the city centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Ticket from Melaka Sentral to Mahkota Parade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Melaka Sentral."

    "section": "Getting there",
    "text": "Getting there\nI hate flying, mostly because I hate airports and all the wasted time in waiting around, standing in lines, going through security after security, followed by some more waiting around in departure lounges. It also happens to be one of the few things that bring out the worst in humanity — in my experience, at least. In any case, it was the only reasonable way of my getting there — walking, driving, or sailing really was not an option.\nI bought a one-way ticket to Kuala Lumpur from Manchester, to transit at Abu Dhabi, for £445.63. Many countries will refuse you entry if you cannot show onward travel documents. There is no mention of this for Malaysia on the FCDO, but, just to be safe, I paid 5 MYR (~£1) for a train ticket from the last stop in Malaysia (JB Sentral) to the first stop in Singapore (Woodlands). There is a company that specialises in sorting out onward air tickets, aptly called Onward Ticket, but parting with £20 just seemed a waste of money to me.\n\n1: Manchester Airport to Abu Dhabi Airport\nThis was a six-hour 30-minute flight, made bearable only by the two people sat next to me: Dianne and Liam, a couple in their mid-50s from Yorkshire flying to Goa, India. Dianne, an easy conversationalist, is an avid motorbiker. She regaled me with stories of how she and Liam rode east to west on a Harley in the US, and similar trips to continental Europe. Being a biker myself, I was, of course, jealous but happy for them. They were nice and more than happy to share their stories (and snacks!).\n\n\n2: Abu Dhabi Airport to Kuala Lumpur Airport\nI was meant to transit in Abu Dhabi for one hour 30 minutes, but with delays taking off from Manchester it was essentially a hop-off-hop-on at Abu Dhabi.\nElated at being seated near to the door where there is ample leg space without my having to fork out any extra money, my elation quickly turned into despair after I was quickly surrounded by three incessantly crying babies and their useless parents in tow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNever pay extra for the seats at the front; they are usually reserved for parents with babies.\n\n\nNeedless to say, not an ounce of sleep or peace came my way and, after an excruciating seven-hour ordeal, I was more than happy to bolt out the exit as soon as the plane landed. I had no desire to relive the ordeal at the immigration line. Did I tell you I hated flying?\nIt turns out, Malaysia no longer have traditional immigration counters where passports are stamped. You self-declare a mandatory MDAC before you arrive and scan your passport at the gate and that is it. You are free to go. Of course, for some countries, the full KY jelly and rubber glove treatment still applies.\nThough it is far less hassle and bureaucratic, I miss not having my passport stamped. I mean, having a passport full of stamps from different countries is part of a backpacker’s experience — like an official record of when and where you said no to the sedentary life in favour of the nomadic wilderness. But, I guess, life is transient and these worldly inks are just as ephemeral.\n\n\n3: Kuala Lumpur Airport to Kuala Lumpur City Centre\nLike all airports, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is quite a way away from Kuala Lumpur city centre; so, the first thing I needed to do was make my way to the centre. My options were\n\nTaxi\nUse the Grab app (South East Asia’s most popular taxi app). Cost: no more than 110 MYR (~20 GBP).\nTrain\nThere are two trains: (i) KL Transit and (ii) KL Ekspress (yes, that is how they spell it). They are essentially the same, except the KL Ekspress is a direct, non-stop, airport-centre service. Cost: 55 MYR (~10 GBP), taking 30 minutes.\nBus\nCost: 15 MYR (~3 GBP), taking upwards of an hour.\n\nBeing a backpacker, I was never going to take the taxi option. I had wanted to take the bus, but, after 14 hours on an aeroplane, cramped like sardines in a can (at first) and devoid of any sleep (second), I decided to take the KL Ekspress direct to KL Sentral.\nArriving at KL Sentral, the immediate area surrounding the train station is not pedestrian friendly. With a spaghetti mess of mutiple-lane carriageways snaking around multiple train stations close by, it was a mare trying to navigate my way out north. It was hot (28 °C), it was humid, and the air felt stale, but the life of a backpacker is to see the world and so I was never going to call a taxi. I ploughed on ahead on foot.\nThough I was tired, it was still too early to check into my hotel. I needed to slow down. I visited the National Mosque of Malaysia, Independence Square, the National Textiles Museum, and the beautiful Sultan Abdul Samad Building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The mosque from the outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Main prayer hall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The National Mosque of Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The National Textile Museum building in the distance.\n\n\n\nOn top of being sleep-deprived, I was now hungry and sweating profusely. Blundering my way ever-forward, I stumbled upon a strong and vibrant south Indian and Bangladeshi community in the Masjid India (aka Little India) corner of Kuala Lumpur. I walked into a restaurant hoping for a strong desi chai to keep me awake. The boy who served me — a young boy in his late teens from Tamil Nadu — suggested I try their traditional food, served in their traditional manner: on the leaf of a banana tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Food on the leaf of a banana tree. All for a princely sum of 8 MYR (~1.50 GBP).\n\n\n\nThe food was nice and it hit the spot, but more than anything it was served with love. The boy sat with me and talked about how today was the Pongol festival back home and how he dearly missed not being there with his family. He came to Malaysia to earn money, given the lack of opportunities in his home country.\nStepping out of the restaurant’s cool beguiling air and into the outside heat, it struck me again just how hot Malaysia is. Of course, I knew this beforehand. It’s January, I thought; it should be a little cooler, right?"

These are weather stations found in airports all aound the world, many of which have been collecting data for more than 50 years.

It is not uncommon for several days in a month to reach 100% relative humidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Temperature in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Relative humidity in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Climate in Kuala Lumpur.1\n\n\n\nInsofar as temperature and relative humidity are concerned, Kuala Lumpur is quite monoclimatic year-round.
