<p>Kuala Lumpur is the first stop in my Asia trip. Founded on the muddy confluence of the Gumbak and Klang rivers by, in part, Chinese tin miners and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano">bat poo</a> excavators in the 1800s, it is today one of the fastest growing cities in South East Asia.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="manchester-to-abu-dhabi">Manchester to Abu Dhabi</h2>
<p>This was a six-hour 30-minute flight, made bearable only by the two people sat next to me: Dianne and Liam, a couple in their mid-50s from Yorkshire flying to Goa, India. Dianne, an easy conversationalist, is an avid motorbiker. She regaled me with stories of how she and Liam rode east to west on a Harley in the US, and similar trips to continental Europe. Being a biker myself, I was, of course, jealous but happy for them. They were nice and more than happy to share their stories (and snacks!).</p>

<section id="abu-dhabi-to-kuala-lumpur" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abu-dhabi-to-kuala-lumpur">Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>I was meant to transit in Abu Dhabi for one hour 30 minutes, but with delays taking off from Manchester, it was essentially a hop-off-hop-on at Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Elated at being seated near to the door where there is ample leg space without my having to fork out any extra money, my elation quickly turned into despair after I was quickly surrounded by three incessantly crying babies and their useless parents in tow.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Never pay extra for the seats at the front; they are usually reserved for parents with babies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Needless to say, not an ounce of sleep or peace came my way and, after an excruciating seven-hour ordeal, I was more than happy to bolt out the exit as soon as the plane landed. I had no desire to relive the ordeal at the immigration line.</p>
<p>It turns out, Malaysia no longer have traditional immigration counters where passports are stamped. You self-declare a mandatory <a href="https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main">MDAC</a> before you arrive and scan your passport at the gate and that is it. You are free to go. Of course, for some countries, the full KY jelly and rubber glove treatment still applies.</p>
<p>Though it is far less hassle and bureaucratic, I miss not having my passport stamped. I mean, having a passport full of stamps from different countries is part of a backpacker’s experience — like an official record of when and where you said <em>no</em> to the sedentary life in favour of the nomadic wilderness. But, I guess, life is transient and these worldly inks are just as ephemeral.</p>

<section id="kuala-lumpur" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kuala-lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>Like all airports, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is quite a way away from Kuala Lumpur city centre; so, the first thing I needed to do was make my way to the centre. My options were</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Taxi</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&amp;hl=en_GB">Grab</a> app (South East Asia’s most popular taxi app). Cost: no more than 110 MYR (~20 GBP).</p></li>
<li><p>Train</p>
<p>There are two trains: (i) KL Transit and (ii) KL Ekspress (yes, that is how they spell it). They are essentially the same, except the KL Ekspress is a direct, non-stop, airport-centre service. Cost: 55 MYR (~10 GBP), taking 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Bus</p>
<p>Cost: 15 MYR (~3 GBP), taking upwards of an hour.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Being a backpacker, I was never going to take the taxi option. I had wanted to take the bus, but, after 14 hours on an aeroplane, cramped like sardines in a can (at first) and devoid of any sleep (second), I decided to take the KL Ekspress direct to KL Sentral.</p>
<p>Arriving at KL Sentral, the immediate area surrounding the train station is not pedestrian friendly. With a spaghetti mess of mutiple-lane carriageways snaking around multiple train stations close by, it was a mare trying to navigate my way out north. It was hot (26 °C), it was humid, and the air felt stale, but the life of a backpacker is to see the world and so I was never going to call a taxi. I ploughed on ahead on foot.</p>
<p>Though I was tired, it was still too early to check into my hotel. I needed to slow down. I visited the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AkV17uJaDCHmJPmf7">National Mosque of Malaysia</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJsomsqU1zDb7CSw7">Independence Square</a>, and the beautiful <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKJkyTh9vzNC3bDLA">Sultan Abdul Samad Building</a>.</p>

<p>On top of being sleep-deprived, I was now hungry and sweating profusely. Blundering my way ever-forward, I stumbled upon a strong and vibrant south Indian and Bangladeshi community in the <em>Masjid India</em> (aka <em>Little India</em>) corner of Kuala Lumpur. I walked into a restaurant hoping for a strong <em>desi chai</em> to keep me awake. The boy who served me — a young boy in his late teens from Tamil Nadu — suggested I try their traditional food, served in their traditional manner: on the leaf of a banana tree.</p>

<p>The food was nice and it hit the spot, but more than anything it was served with love. The boy sat with me and talked about how today was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pongal_(festival)">Pongol</a> festival back home and how he dearly missed not being there with his family. He came to Malaysia to earn money, given the lack of opportunities in his home country.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the restaurant’s cool beguiling air and into the outside heat, it struck me again just how hot Malaysia is. Of course, I knew this beforehand. <em>It’s January</em> I thought; <em>it should be a little cooler</em>, right?</p>

<section id="climate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="climate">Climate</h2>
<p>There are many facets to climate, but the ones I care about most right now are <em>temperature</em> and <em>humidity</em>.</p>
<p>There is an <code>R</code> package called <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/riem">{riem}</a> that allows you to get hold of weather data from Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS). These are weather stations found in airports all aound the world, many of which have been collecting data for more than 50 years. The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) dataset stretches back to 1949, but limiting myself to 2010 it looks like Kula Lumpur’s temperature hovers aound 28 °C <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpm"> 2 °C, while relative humidity hovers around 80% all year round. It is not uncommon for several days in a month to reach 100% relative humidity.</p>

<p>Insofar as temperature and relative humidity are concerned, Kuala Lumpur is quite monoclimatic year-round. At 80% relative humidity, no wonder you feel so hot: with the air already saturated with water, it is difficult for your sweat to evaporate and transfer the thermal energy into the surroundings.</p>

<p>If you are here, you are probably lost. You must be a rambler. Maybe not in person, but certainly in mind and in spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Ramble</strong></p>
<p>/răm′bəl/</p>
<p>intransitive verb</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To move about aimlessly. Synonym: wander.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The mind rambles for hours in the labyrinth of roads not taken.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Much ink has been spilled on the meaning of Robert Frost’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4XFCxNY96k"><em>The Road Not Taken</em></a>. <sup>1</sup> If you are worried that I intend to present myself as the wise-old-man-who-thinks-he-knows-it-all, don’t be. I know very little, if any, about poetry and less still about life. Instead, here, you will find my prosaic musings on some of the roads <em>I</em> took.</p>
