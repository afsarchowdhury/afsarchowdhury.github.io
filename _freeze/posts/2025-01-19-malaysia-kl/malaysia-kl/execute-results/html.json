Founded on the muddy confluence of the Gumbak and Klang rivers by Chinese tin miners and [bat poo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano) excavators in the 1800s, it is today one of the fastest growing cities in South East Asia.\n\nThe first step, though, is to get there.\n\n## Manchester to Abu Dhabi\n\nThis was a 6 h 30 min flight, made bearable only by the two people sat next to me: Dianne and Liam, a couple in their mid-50s from Yorkshire flying to Goa, India.  Dianne, an easy conversationalist, \n\n## Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur\n\nI was meant to transit in Abu Dhabi for 1 h 30 min, but with delays taking off from Manchester, it was essentially a hop-off-hop-on at Abu Dhabi.\n\n## Kuala Lumpur\n\nLike all airports, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is quite a way away from Kuala Lumpur city centre; so, the first thing I needed to do is make my way to the centre.  Here were my options:\n\n1. Taxi\n\n   Use the [Grab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&hl=en_GB) app (South East Asia's most popular taxi app).  Cost: no more than 110 MYR (~20 GBP).\n\n2. Train\n\n   There are two trains: (i) KL Transit and (ii) KL Ekspress (yes, that is how they spell it).  They are essentially the same, except the KL Ekspress is a direct, non-stop, airport-centre service.  Cost: 55 MYR (~10 GBP), taking 30 min.\n\n3. Bus\n\n   Cost: 15 MYR (~3 GBP), taking 1 h.\n\nBeing a backpacker, I was never going to take the taxi option.  I had wanted to take the bus, but, after 14 hours on an aeroplane, cramped like sardines in a can and devoid of any sleep because of incessentaly crying babies, I decided to take the KL Ekspress train direct to KL Sentral.\n\nThe immediate area surrounding KL Sentral is not pedestrian friendly.  With a spaghetti mess of mutiple-lane carriageways snaking around multiple train stations close by, it was a mare trying to navigate my way out north.  It was hot (26 °C), it was humid, and the air felt stale, but the life of a backpacker is to see the world and so I was never going to call a taxi.  I ploughed on ahead on foot.\n\nThough I was tired, it was still too early to check into my hotel.  I needed to slow down.  I visited the [National Mosque of Malaysia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AkV17uJaDCHmJPmf7); [Independence Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJsomsqU1zDb7CSw7); the beautiful [Sultan Abdul Samad Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKJkyTh9vzNC3bDLA), an old government building from the 1800s.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The National Mosque of Malaysia.](img/kl_national_mosque.jpg){fig-align='left' width=700}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sultan Abdul Samad Building in the distance .](img/kl_old_gov_building.jpg){fig-align='left' width=700}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-places layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Surus](\"img/kl_national_mosque.jpg\"){#fig-mosque}\n\n![Hanno](\"img/kl_old_gov_building.jpg\"){#fig-sasb}\n\nFamous places\n:::\n\nTired and hungry, I stumbled upon a strong and vibrant south Indian community in the *Little India* corner of KL.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Food on a banana tree leaf.](img/kl_banana_leaf.jpg){fig-align='left' width=700}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt was nice and it hit the spot.  All for a princly sum of 8 MYR (~1.50 GBP)\n\n## Climate\n\nThere are many facets to climate, but the one I cared about most was *temperature*, and I was never going believe what other people had to say.\n\nThere is an `R` package called [{riem}](https://github.com/ropensci/riem) that allows you to get hold of weather data from Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS).  These are weather stations found in airports all aound the world, many of which have been collecting data for more than 50 years.  The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) dataset stretches back to 1949, but limiting myself to 2010 it looks like Kula Lumpur's temperature hovers aound 28 °C $\\pm$ 2 °C all year round.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\" fig-label='temperature'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Temperature in Kuala Lumpur.](img/2025-01-17-Kuala Lumpur_WMSA_temp_vs_time_monthly_2010-01-01_to_2024-12-01.png){fig-align='left' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n![Temperature in Kuala Lumpur.](2025-01-17-Kuala Lumpur_WMSA_temp_vs_time_monthly_2010-01-01_to_2024-12-01.png){.lightbox}",
