I was sat in a cafe in Bukit Bintang (the Piccadilly Circus of Kuala Lumpur) with a Finnish dude --- a fellow traveller doing the Asian archipelago circuit --- whose name I can neither pronounce nor type out.  After exchanging niceties, he asked "was it a good a school?"  I have always thought of my last school as a great school and my answer should have been immediate, but it was not.  I paused.  The question had thrown me off track.  It was like asking a physicist *what is light?*.
