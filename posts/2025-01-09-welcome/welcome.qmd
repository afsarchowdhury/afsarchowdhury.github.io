If you are here, you are probably lost.  You must be a rambler.  Maybe not in person, but certainly in mind and in spirit.

**Ramble**

/răm′bəl/

intransitive verb

* To move about aimlessly.  Synonym: wander.

   > The mind rambles for hours in the labyrinth of roads not taken.

Much ink has been spilled on the meaning of Robert Frost's [*The Road Not Taken*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4XFCxNY96k). [^1]  If you are worried that I intend to present myself as the wise-old-man-who-thinks-he-knows-it-all, don't be.  I know very little, if any, about poetry and less still about life.  Instead, here, you will find my prosaic musings on some of the roads *I* took.
