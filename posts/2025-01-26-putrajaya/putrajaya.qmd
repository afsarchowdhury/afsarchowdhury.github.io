## Putrajaya, Malaysia

Back in 1999, the Malaysian government decided to move from the centre of Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya, about 16 miles due south.  Having made my way to Kuala Lumpur, it would have been a shame to not make a quick, cheeky, visit to the new centre of government.

## Getting there

The bus KRTravelT523 leaves hourly from [Hab Lebuh Pudu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yniGdF6dtqV7aa6D6) bus station and takes about an hour to get straight to the action in [Putra Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TSpisiyYCopicNSF6).  It costs 4 MYR (~£0.80 GBP), which is great value for an hour's bus ride.

The driver allowed passengers to board at 09:45 and departed exactly on schedule, 10:00.  So, make sure you are on time.

## Putra Square

As with all city "squares" out there, I have no idea why they call it a *square*, because it is actually a *circle*.  In any case, as the bus arrives at Putra Square, you can see that the government mean business: grand structures designed with an infusion of cultures ready to stand the test of time, with a hint of intent, signalling to the world that Malaysia's time has come.

### Prime Minister's office

For obvious reasons, the Prime Minister's office is not accessible to the general public.

### Putra Masjid

The Putra Masjid sits adjacent to the Prime Minister's office.  It was constructed in 1999 with rose-tinted granite on the banks of the [Putrajaya Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya_Lake), a 650-hectare man-made colossal cooling system.

## Other activities

Once you have had a wander around the square, the mosque, the artisan stalls, shopping mall, you can take a boat ride on the lake, from where the mosque appears to float on water.

## Costs

Here is a breakdown of the cost of the trip.

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Create dataframe
df_cost <- tibble::tribble(
  ~"Item",                                    ~"Cost in MYR",
  "Bus ticket to Putra Square",               4,
  "Bus ticket from Putra Square",             4
)

# Create total
df_cost <- df_cost |>
  janitor::adorn_totals(where = "row")

my_cost_total <- df_cost[[nrow(df_cost), ncol(df_cost)]]

# Create table
tbl <- df_cost |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt::opt_row_striping() |>
  gt::tab_options(table.align = "left") |>
  gt::tab_options(table.font.names = "Verdana Pro")

tbl
```

A sum total of `{r} my_cost_total` MYR to get there and back.  At a conversion ratio of 1:5.4 GBP:MYR, that works out to be £`{r} round(my_cost_total / 5.4, 2)`.
